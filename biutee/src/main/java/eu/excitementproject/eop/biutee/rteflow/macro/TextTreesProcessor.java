/**
 * 
 * Given list of parse-trees, created from the text, and a parse-tree created
 * from the hypothesis, this class applies generation-operations until
 * the hypothesis tree is generated (i.e. a proofs is found).
 * <BR>
 * After the process, the best tree (i.e. the tree that was generated,
 * and is identical to the hypothesis, using the lowest cost operations) can be
 * retrieved by {@link #getBestTree()}.
 * <P>
 * There are several implementations of this interface. However, most of them
 * share common properties, especially they share several initializations.
 * In any normal case, implementation can be a sub-class of {@link AbstractTextTreesProcessor}.
 * Even for the cases in which {@link AbstractTextTreesProcessor} cannot be used, it
 * is recommended that the implementation will be a sub-class of {@link InitializationTextTreesProcessor}.
 * <P>
 * Note also that some initializations are performed in {@link DocumentInitializer},
 * so don't jump from pre-processing to {@link TextTreesProcessor}, but rather
 * initialize your document in {@link DocumentInitializer}, and then proceed to
 * {@link TextTreesProcessor} (which, as noted, should begin with {@link InitializationTextTreesProcessor#init()}).

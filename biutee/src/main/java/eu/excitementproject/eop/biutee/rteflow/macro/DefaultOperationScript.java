/**
 * 
 * This {@link OperationsScript} is "always do everything". All operations and
 * rule bases are activated in each "iteration" which is interpreted as an expansion
 * of a tree.
 * 
 * The iteration-index is the distance from the original tree, i.e. how many expansions
 * were done in the history of the current tree.
 * <P>
 * An important note about the flow (this is a somewhat
 * complicated issue):
 * When a rule application operation is performed, it should be reflected
 * by the feature vector that represents that operation.
 * This is done by {@link FeatureUpdate}'s methods.
 * In order to put the relevant value into the <B>correct</B>
 * feature, it has to know the feature index. The feature index
 * is an integer, mapped to the rule base name.
 * Thus, a mapping of rule-bases to the corresponding feature-indexes
 * is maintained by {@link FeatureVectorStructureOrganizer}. An instance
 * of {@link FeatureVectorStructureOrganizer} is given to {@link FeatureUpdate}
 * as a parameter, providing this mapping.
 * {@link FeatureVectorStructureOrganizer} builds this mapping by getting a list
 * (actually it is a {@link LinkedHashSet}) of the rule-bases used by the system.
 * <BR>
 * Therefore there are some points to be aware of:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>When adding knowledge resources, their names
 * are added as well, as keys to one of the maps:
 * byLemmaPosLexicalRuleBases, byLemmaLexicalRuleBases,
 * ruleBasesEnvelopes</LI>
 * <LI>When adding a knowledge resource that is a composition
 * of several knowledge resources (e.g. chain-of-lexical-rules)
 * All of the knowledge resources names must be added to the
 * envelope of that added composition. This is done by the method
 * {@link RuleBaseEnvelope#setRuleBasesNames(LinkedHashSet)}</LI>
 * <LI>In {@link OperationsScript}, the method {@link #getRuleBasesNames()}
 * automatically retrieves the rule bases names from the keys
 * of the maps mentioned above, and from all rule-bases-envelope that
 * were created for <B>meta rule bases</B></LI>
 * <LI>In the initialization of {@link FeatureUpdate}, it
 * calls the method {@link FeatureVectorStructureOrganizer#getRuleBasesFeatures()}, which
 * returns a map from rule-bases-names to feature indexes.</LI>
 * <LI>The rule-base-name is also available in {@link SingleOperationItem}
 * for each item that is a rule-base-application operation.</LI>
 * <LI>In {@link TreesGeneratorByOperations}, in each rule
 * application operation that is being performed, the
 * rule-base-name is retrieved (either) by the name
 * stored in {@link SingleOperationItem}, or from the
 * rule base envelope by the method {@link RuleBaseEnvelope#getRuleBasesNames()}.
 * That name is given to {@link FeatureUpdate}, and since that
 * name exists in the map that was constructed by {@link FeatureVectorStructureOrganizer}
 * - it knows to which feature it has to put the corresponding value.</LI>
 * </UL>

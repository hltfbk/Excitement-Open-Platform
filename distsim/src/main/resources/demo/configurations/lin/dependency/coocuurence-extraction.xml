		* eu.excitementproject.eop.distsim.builders.cooccurrence.NodeBasedWordCooccurrenceExtraction
		   Extracts co-occurrences, each composed of two words with their dependency relation, from a given parsed sentences, represented a BasicNode. 
		   Required features:
			* relevant-pos-list: a list of selected part-of-speech for the extracted words. If this feature is not defined, all part-of-speeches will be accepted. The name of the pos should be defined in capital letters, according to the enum strings of CanonicalPosTag.
		* eu.excitementproject.eop.distsim.builders.cooccurrence.NodeBasedPredArgCooccurrenceExtraction
		   Extracts co-occurrences, each composed of a binary predicate and one of its arguments with a relation which indicates the position of the argument (X, Y), from a given parsed sentences, represented a BasicNode.
		* eu.excitementproject.eop.distsim.builders.cooccurrence.TupleBasedPredArgCooccurrenceExtraction
		   Extracts co-occurrences, each composed of a binary predicate and one of its arguments with a relation which indicates the position of the argument (X, Y), from a given string representation of a tuple of binary predicate and its two arguments.
        * eu.excitementproject.eop.distsim.builders.cooccurrence.RawTextBasedWordCooccurrenceExtraction
           Extracts co-occurrence, composed of word pairs that appear in a given window, in a given raw text sentence. Required properties:
           Required features:
            * window-size: the size of window in which word pairs are taken, e.g., for window-size 2, two words ahead and two words back are candidate pairs for the given word (default, 3).
            * stop-words-file: the path to a text file, composed of stop words to be filtered from the model, word per line (default, no stop-word list).

		     Returns the next line of the stream as a textual sentence, where the last tab-separated string in the line indicates its frequency.
		  * eu.excitementproject.eop.distsim.builders.reader.SerializedNodeSentenceReader
		     Returns a BasicNode representation of the next parsed sentence, by deserializating the next line of the stream.
		  * eu.excitementproject.eop.distsim.reader.cooccurrence.CollNodeSentenceReader
		     Returns a BasicNode representation of the next parsed sentence, by the converting the next lines from Conll representation of a sentence to a BasicNode. 
		     Required property:
		         * part-of-speech-class: a class which extends the eu.excitementproject.eop.common.representation.PartOfSpeech class, by mapping a specific set of part-of-speeches into the canonical representation, defined by the eu.excitementproject.eop.common.representation.CanonicalPosTag enum type.
		  * eu.excitementproject.eop.distsim.builders.reader.UIMANodeSentenceReader
		     Returns a BasicNode represention of the next parsed sentence, given a UIMA Cas representation of parsed corpus. 
		     Required property:
		         * ae-template-file: a path for the analysis engine template file of the given UIMA Cas (otherwise, a default one will be selected).
		  * eu.excitementproject.eop.distsim.builders.reader.UKwacNodeSentenceReader
		     Returns a BasicNode representation of the next parsed sentence, given a UkWAC corpus.

		     Returns a BasicNode representation of the next parsed sentence, given EOP's serialization of parsed corpus (as defined in the eu.excitementproject.eop.common.representation.parse.tree.dependency.basic.xmldom.XmlTreePartOfSpeechFactory class).
		     Required property:
                         * ignore-saved-canonical-pos-tag: does the representation ignore saved canonical pos tag (default, true).

/**
 * This is the top level interface for wrappers of lexical resources. Its methods accept tuples of <code>< lemma, part of speech></code> and 
 * retrieve {@link LexicalRule}s
 * that match the criteria (each rule contains a resource-specific {@link RuleInfo} record).<br> 
 * In case the user gives <code>null</code> POS, implementations must retrieve rules for all possible POSs.<br>
 * In case the user gives a POS that is not supported by the implemented lexical resource, then the implementation must return an empty list (not null). 
 * For instance, Wikipedia supports only nouns, and WordNet supports only nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs.     
 * <p>
 * If, in a particular implementation, rules can be filtered by some criteria, then that filtering should be configurable in the {@link LexicalResource}'s
 * constructor, and the criteria should also appear (not as a filter) in the respective implementation of {@link RuleInfo}.
 * <p>
 * In addition, each implementation must accept a constant <code>limitOnRetrievedRules</code> that defines the max number of rules to be returned for each 
 * query. The returned rules should always be the best available. This const should be accepted via Ctor.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note</b> The {@link LexicalResource} is oblivious of the context of the {@code lemma+pos}s it gets. E.g. it would retrieve the same rules for 
 * {@code < Windows, NOUN>} whether the context is OS or interior design. So <b>it is the user's responsibility to disambiguate</b> such terms.

/**
 * Annotates a class or interface as thread-safe.
 * This annotation is not mandatory. Not every class has to be
 * annotated.
 * However it is a good practice to do that in cases that it are not
 * naturally clear.
 * <P>
 * <B>Interpretation of this annotations:</B><BR>
 * An instance of the annotated class <B>is shared</B> by different
 * threads.<BR>
 * If you implement / extends a class that is annotated as
 * thread-safety=true - this means that <B>you must</B> take
 * care on thread-safety issues, since it is assumed that instances
 * of your class will be shared among threads parallelly.<BR>
 * <P>
 * <B>Note:</B> If it is safe to share only some methods of the class
 * among different threads, but not all of them, for example - a
 * classifier that can be shared among thread for classifying samples,
 * but the training must be done only once by a single thread - then it
 * <B>should not</B> be annotated by this annotation. Such cases should
 * be documented in Java-Doc.
 * <P>
 * This might be somewhat confusing, so be aware of the following:<BR>
 * Not-thread-safe is the <B>easier</B> case from programmer's
 * point of view. Since if a class is not thread safe, the programmer
 * can assume that the user of the class will not share its instances
 * among threads, so the programmer does not have to take care of
 * thread-safety issues.<BR>
 * On the contrary, it is harder to write a class (and its subclasses)
 * that <B>is</B> thread safe, since it will be shared among threads,
 * so the programmer should make sure it is written in a way that is safe
 * to be shared among threads.
 * <P>
 * Note: This annotation is inherited. This means that a not only the class annotated
 * by this annotation must be thread-safe, <B>but also all of its subclasses</B>.

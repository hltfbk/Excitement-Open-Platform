 * This is an annotation for {@link AdditionalNodeInformation}s pertaining to predicate nodes that says

 * (UNKNOWN) or whether the system did not identify anything about it (UNSPECIFIED). For non predicate nodes it is undefined.

 * <li>{-} He did not look --> has {-} cos he actually didn't look
 * <li>He refused [{-} (he) to look]  --> has {-} cos he actually didn't look
 * <li>He refused [{+} (he) not to look] --> has {+} cos he actually looked

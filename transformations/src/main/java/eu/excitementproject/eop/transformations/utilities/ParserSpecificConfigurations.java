/**
 * 
 * Methods to maintain a static global state of parser-mode, which indicates which
 * parser is used in the system, globally.
 * <P>
 * At the very beginning of every flow in the system, the parser mode should be stated. This
 * is done by calling (as early as possible, and only once) to the static method {@link #changeParser(PARSER)}.
 * <BR>
 * This is done by {@link SystemInitialization#init()} method.
 * <P>
 * The reason I don't like this solution is that misusing this class, as well as forgetting
 * to use it at all, is an error that cannot be caught in compilation time, and in some
 * circumstances not even in run-time.
 * Actually it is also conceptually bad, since it breaks the program structure. It is not
 * structurally part of the system flow (this class is just some static methods that "fly" in
 * the system, not structurally connected to anything), and not object oriented.
 * However, currently I have to use this ad-hoc bad solution.

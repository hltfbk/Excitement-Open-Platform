/**
 * Produces a parse-tree (dependency tree) from a sentence.
 * This interface is a base interface for {@link BasicParser}, and
 * {@link BasicPipelinedParser}.
 * <P>
 * Usage: First call {@link #init()} method, than start parsing
 * any number of sentences required.
 * When the {@linkplain BasicParser} object is no longer to be used, the
 * {@link #cleanUp()} method should be called.
 * <P>
 * To parse sentences: the sentence has to be set. This is done by some
 * setXXX() method in one of the sub-interfaces.
 * Then call {@link #parse()} method, then you can get the parse tree
 * by calling {@link #getParseTree()} method.
 * <P>
 * More sophisticated usage would be making some manipulations on the
 * parse tree <B> after </B> calling the {@link #parse()} method, and
 * <B> before </B> calling the {@link #getParseTree()} method.
 * That usage can be done by calling the methods:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>{@link #getMutableParseTree()} </LI>
 * <LI>{@link #getNodesAsList()} </LI>
 * <LI>{@link #getNodesOrderedByWords()} </LI>
 * </UL>
 * after {@link #parse()} and before {@link #getParseTree()}.

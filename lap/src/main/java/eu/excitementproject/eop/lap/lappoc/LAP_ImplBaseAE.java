/**
 * 
 * <I>(Before reading / using this implementation base, first do read about LAP_ImplBase for the role of an LAP implementation base).</I> 
 * <P>
 * This is an extended, and a more efficient version of LAP Implementation Base ({@link LAP_ImplBase}), if the underlying annotation is done by AEs. 
 * Compared to the base class, this class is specifically designed to provide methods of LAPAccess ({@link eu.excitementproject.eop.lap.LAPAccess}) 
 * based on existing AEs (for example, DKPro modules).  
 * If you are adding a new linguistic analysis pipeline (LAP) with a set of existing AEs; this implementation base is better than the base LAP_ImplBase. 
 * </P>
 * 
 * <H2> Why this implementation base is needed? </H2> 
 * <P>
 * A generic (normal, non multi-view) UIMA AE only work on a single "View" of a CAS. 
 * We can "map" a generic AE to work on a specific view (like TextView or HypothesisView),
 * when the AE is initialized as a part of an aggregated analysis engine (AAE).  
 * 
 * <P>
 * The problem is that, once this mapping is done; the assigned AE cannot work on other views. View mapping is one-time thing, at the initialization time of the AE within aggregated pipeline. 
 * Since our LAPAccess needs to work on any given view, the base LAP_ImplBase simply re-map 
 * this "View mapping" each time it works on a new view. This means, the underlying AE gets re-initialized each time it works on a view. 
 * This is not a problem if the underlying AE initialization code is smart enough to init only once (like using singletons, etc), or initialization time is very short. 
 * Sadly, many AEs, do need long initialization time. (For example, model loading of a parser, etc). For such a case, using base LAP_ImplBase is not acceptible. 
 * 
 * <H2> How this class resolves the issue? </H2> 
 * 
 * <P>
 * Once mapped, UIMA AE works on this mapped view for its life cycle. We cannot change that. 
 * However, we can declare we will work only on a set of "previously defined" views. 
 * 
 * <P> 
 * This implementation base first gets an array of view names (as string), 
 * and prepare a pipeline for each of the view. Thus, when addAnnotationOn() method is called, 
 * it will use a specifically prepared pipeline for the request. If the request is on a view 
 * name that is unknown, it will simply give up and raise an exception. 
 * 
 * <H2> So What to override? </H2> 
 * <P> 
 * If you want to provide a LAPAccess module based on this implementation base, 
 * you have to override two methods. One is the constructor, and the other is 
 * listOfAEDescriptors(). In the constructor, you simply need to set language ID, & call super(). 
 * The method listOfAEDescriptors(), will be called in the constructor of ImplBaseAE code, and 
 * you have to return an ordered array of AnalysisEngineDescriptor. 
 * 
 * <P> 
 * Unlike {@link LAP_ImplBase}, you don't need to override addAnnotationOn(), since it is 
 * already provided by this class. However, you have to provide the list of AEs that will 
 * be used in the addAnnotationOn(), in the forms of ordered list of AE Descriptors.   
 * 
 * <P> Sometimes, an example is much easier to understand than the description. 
 * For a usage example of this implementation base, see {@link ExampleLAPAE} </P>

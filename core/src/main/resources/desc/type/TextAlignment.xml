          <description>This feature holds references to other AlignedText instances. The array can have multiple references, which means that it is one-to-many alignment. Likewise, a null array can also be a valid value for this feature, if the underlying alignment method is an asymmetric one; empty array means that this AlignedText instance is a recipient, but it does not align itself to other text.</description>

		<!-- Specifies the maximum accepted amount of derivation steps between two derivationally related lemmas
		     to count as entailment pair. Integer values range between 1 and 10.
		     Each pair of lemmas within one derivational family is connected by a set of derivation rules. If one
		     lemma l2 can be directly derived from lemma l1, they are connected by one rule, thus, the number of
		     derivation steps is one. If l1 derives to l2, and l2 derives to l3, then the pair l1-l3 is connected
		     by two derivation steps, etc. The maximum amount of derivation steps to combine two lemmas is ten.
		     We assume the following: The more derivation steps must be carried out to connect two lemmas, the less 
		     probable it is that these two lemmas are really derivationally related - and thus they are less probable
		     to build an enailment relationship. 
		     Thus, a low value for the property "derivationSteps" only considers lemmas which are highly probably related.   
 		     This property is only considered if the property "useScores" = true.
